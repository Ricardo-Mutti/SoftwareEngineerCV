\section{Work History}

\vspace{6pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\cventry{May 2018 -- Current}{Lead Big Data Engineer - Associate Director}{\href{https://www.btgpactualdigital.com}{BTG Pactual}}{São Paulo, Brazil}{}{\vspace{3pt}
BTG Pactual is the largest investment bank in Latin America. Upon my arrival on BTG I worked on building the foundations of a Data Analytics team.\\
My first project was to create a centralized Data Lake for BTG Pactual Digital, the new online banking business, accounting for all possible information of our customers as well as presenting the ultimate source for our digital marketing strategies and business KPIs. I worked for one year in this project.\\
After that I led another project with similar characteristics. I created a new Data Lake comprising financial market information and oversaw its operations while leading a team of four Data Engineers. Ultimately achieving the goal of democratizing data access throughout the corporation and promoting an environment for quantitative analysis.\\
All in all, during my experience at BTG, I acquired expertise in managing big loads of data, whilst achieving cost effectiveness, optimal processing time and low maintenance status.\\
Main Stack: Nifi, S3, Airflow, EMR, Pyspark, Parquet, Glue, Athena.}}

\item{\cventry{Jan 2016 -- May 2018}{Software Engineer}{\href{https://www.appsimples.com.br}{AppSimples}}{São Paulo, Brazil}{}{\vspace{3pt}Appsimples is a software house start-up, aiming at solving real world problems through technology. I was one of the first employees and worked there for almost 3 years, in a variety of projects and stacks. \\
I worked with Android apps, iOS apps, websites in ReactJS and even IoT. \\
My time there taught me to easily learn new technologies and programming languages while writing clean, well documented and easy to maintain code.\\
